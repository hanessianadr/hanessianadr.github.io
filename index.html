            Interested parties should not rely on this website as a complete or updated source of disclosure
            information about Mr. Hanessian. Mr. Hanessian does not have ongoing access to the databases of his

            Mr. Hanessian requests any party in a matter for which he is proposed as arbitrator or neutral to disclose
            promptly any facts or circumstances considered relevant to his impartiality or independence as
            soon as that information is reasonably available and, for that purpose, to undertake a reasonable
            continuing search of publicly available information promptly after learning of his prospective
            appointment.
